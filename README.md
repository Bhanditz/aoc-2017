# Advent of Code 2017

Here's a blank template for working on the [Advent of Code (2017)](http://adventofcode.com/2017). It's got all the
tests you could possibly want with the answers obscured. Just work your way through the puzzles until all the tests
pass!

You can find the puzzle questions [here](http://adventofcode.com/2017).

You can find my answers [here](https://github.com/dlew/aoc-2017/tree/answers). I make no claim to them being any good,
only that they arrive at the correct answer.
